									<p>Here's a brief summary about who I am.</p>

								<p>Hi! My name is Ivy and I'm currently in my 4th year at Cal State LA. I will be graduating this Spring of 2022, with a B.S. degree in Computer Information Systems. I intend to go into business/data analytics, so the skills that I've learned both in school and in my own time leans towards that field. A few examples of the skills I've learned and are also currently learning are SQL, Python, Excel, Tableau, SAS, and SAP.</p>
								<p><Strong>HOW I DECIDED ON MY MAJOR: </Strong> Prior to becoming a Computer Information Systems major, I was in Computer Science. I took various mathematics courses, such as Calculus I, Calculus II, and Linear Algebra, including various Computer Science courses where I learned how to program in Java and also developed my interest in SQL. It was not until the last half of my 2nd year when I decided to switch to CIS. I realized although programming was something important to learn and I should learn, it was something that I didn't want to entirely focus on. Something I also noticed was that I was always interested in learning more about how businesses develop, ran, and grew, which eventually led to my decision to switch to CIS so I could take business courses.</p>
								<p><STRONG>HOW I LEARNED: </STRONG> At my school, there were not a lot of courses that pertains to business or data analytics, but I was able to took all that was offered. Some skills were learned on my own, through YouTube, reading online articles, watching tutorials on LinkedIn Learning, etc. Although I can say I know the basics of all the skills I mentioned earlier, I know I need to become more proficient in those skills, which is why I continue working on projects, self-learning, and looking for a way to gain work experience.</p>
